### Correlation between Each Series and a Master Chronology 
Below is output from `corr.rwl.seg` which is the primary function for looking at the crossdating of a tree-ring data set in `dplR`. This function looks at the correlation between each tree-ring series and a master chronology built from all the other series in the `rwl` object (leave-one-out principle). These correlations are calculated on overlapping segments (e.g., 50-year segments would be overlapped by 25 years). By default, each of the series is filtered (prewhitened) to remove low-frequency variation prior to the correlation analysis. The help file [link] has abundant  details. 

Each series is represented by two courses of lines with the bottom course adhering to the bottom axis timeline and the top course matching the upper axis timeline.  Segments are colored according to the strength of the correlation between  that segment and the master chronology. Blue correlates well (p-values less  or equal to the user-set critical value) while potential dating problems  are indicated by the red segments (p-values greater than the user-set critical value). Green lines show segments that do not completely overlap the time period and thus have no correlations calculated.

Use the widgets below to adjust the arguments. The output is shown graphically and in tables. You can generate a report at the bottom of the page as a stand alone html file. 

Proceed to the next tab to investigate a series more thoroughly (e.g., if you find one with a dating problem).
