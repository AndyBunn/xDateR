### Upload a RWL file
Upload a standard file of ring widths (.rwl) in one of the available formats in `read.rwl` (e.g., a tucson/decadal file). Standard descriptive statistics and a plot are produced. These data will update if series are filtered from the original file in subsequent work with xDateR.
