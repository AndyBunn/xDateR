## Preamble

Welcome to xDateR -- a Shiny app for crossdating tree-ring data. This app will help you do initial quality control on a set of (usually) ring widths and potentially identify dating problems. This uses the existing functions in the `dplR` package. The idea for this app is to provide an interactive environment for assessing dating quality and potentially fixing problems without having to script everything out.

Each tab in this app contains tools for reading in data via a standard `rwl` file read in via `read.rwl()` in `dplR`. Reading in a dataed file is the beginning of the cross-dating process. The `Correlations between Series` tab produces standard correlation statistics based on segment lengths and other options specified by the user. The `Series Correlation` tab allows individual series to be further invetigated and edited to potentialy correct dating problems. Finally floaters.

Remember! Users should never rely purely on statistical crossdating but always go back to the wood to verify what is actually happening.
