Welcome to the beta version of **xDateR** -- a Shiny app for crossdating tree-ring data. This app will help you do initial quality control on a set of (usually) ring widths and potentially identify dating problems.  The idea for this app is to use existing functions in the pacakge [*dplR*](https://rdrr.io/cran/dplR/man/dplR.html) to provide an interactive environment for assessing dating quality and potentially fixing problems.

This app contains tools for crossdating data uploaded in an accepted standard *rwl* file format. You should start by uploading a file using the widget on the left. If you want to use an example data set you can check the "Or use example data" box. The example data are  ring-width data where the dates in some of the series have been deliberately corrupted.

After uploading, standard descriptive statistics and plots are produced in the **Describe RWL Data** tab. This is the beginning of the cross-dating process. The **Correlations between Series** tab produces standard correlation graphs and statistics based on segment length and other options specified by the user. The **Individual Series Correlations** tab allows individual series to be further investigated via running and cross-correlation analyses. Rings can be added and deleted using the **Edit Series** tab. Reports can be saved at every step and a *rwl* file can be written. 

Preliminary functionality to work with undated series (floaters) is available as well. To access those features you can also upload a *rwl* file with arbitary dates after loading a dated *rwl* file. Once you do so, the **Undated Series** tab will appear. There you can to try to find dates for each of those series as compared to the dated *rwl* file. As before, you can use a demo data.

[This project is on GitHub](https://github.com/AndyBunn/dplR/) as is [dplR](https://github.com/AndyBunn/dplR/). 

This app in still in heavy develpoment. Suggestions are welcome!

*Remember! Users should never rely purely on statistical crossdating but always go back to the wood to verify what is actually happening.*
